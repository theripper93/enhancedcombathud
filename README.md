# FAQs

Q: Can you add compatibility for X system?
A: No, Argon is hardcoded for dnd5e. If you want you can make a fork for a specific system. You have to include the licence section and credit the original authors (theripper93, Mouse0270) and include links to our patreon page\website (if provided). While you are free to fork this project it must remain free and you cannot profit out of it.

Q: Why is this kind of item not in the HUD?
A: We had to make a choice on what to include, anything that's not on those categories is not icluded (a 1 minute cast time spell for example, or a consumable that is used as bonus action). Those items will not be addedd. You can use Sets for any item.

Q: Why the items in the HUD are not updating correctly?
A: Only a select number of elements are dynamically updated. If you (for example) add an item to a sheet the change will not be reflected. To update the HUD simply close\reopen
